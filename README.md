# xamplr

xamplr is a set of software tools that supports development of ruby applications.

It consists of three gems hosted on gem cutter, source code on
github.

* xamplr-pp -- this is a pure ruby pull parser
* xamplr -- this is the xampl runtime
* xamplr-gen -- this is the code generator

There is an additional fourth github repository containing
examples and documentation that will be coming soon.

Yes, that means that there's no documentation. And no examples. I agree, this is a very bad situation.

## Installation:

> sudo gem install xamplr-gen

This will install all three gems.


## License:

xamplr-pp and xamlpr are both licensed under the LGPLv3.

xamplr-gen is licensed under AGPLv3

An alternative license may be negotiated, contact me (hutch@xampl.com)
