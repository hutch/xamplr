-- use nokogiri, libxml, then xamplr-pp if installed
-- type experiments
-- mark the repo with creation parameters (so we don't loose them. We
   are setting *defaults* and then using the *defaults* to re-open a
   repo -- this is clearly wrong if the defaults are changed, or the
   persister types are deliberately mixed (which is an intended thing
   to support and was *really* handy in Java)
-- support conversions between types:
     - fs -> tokyo  (no loss of information)
     - tokyo -> fs  (currently all indexing will be lost)
     - fs, tokyo -> in-memory (well, no, won't do this)
-- read-through support, especially handy for in-memory. Makes sense for
   fs and tokyo repos
-- tokyo tyrant persisters
-- add NO-CACHE to tokyo persisters (theory is that they cache at a certain
   level (below object level) and that this will allow sharing of the DB a
   little better -- still don't know about multiple writers to the same repo...
   can tyrant help here.
-- redis, and a couple of others might be interesting (mongo didn't work out)
-- what about SQL dbs? Maybe an SQL or DataMapper version??
