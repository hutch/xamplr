2009-05-30 (version 1.3.x)
  -- support tokyocabinet-1.4.23 and tokyocabinet-ruby-1.23 (looks as though
     this is an optional upgrade)
  -- using default tuning of TC. The former use of deflate seems to double the
     commit times (no significant impact on query time though)

2009-05-13 (version 1.3.1)  REPO BREAKING CHANGE
  -- when querying the TC db, make sure the result returned are uniq
  -- added the ability to describe a xampl object using multiple criteria. This
     is demonstrated in the new example called 'hobbies'

2009-05-12 (version 1.3.0) 
  -- confirmed to work with tokyocabinet-1.4.20 and tokyocabinet-ruby-1.23
  -- the begginings of a new employee example from DDD book
  -- enhancements and cleanup of the graphml generation (nice UML diagrams)
  -- added a new yuml generation capability (very nice UML diagrams)
  -- make xamplr-pp a prerequisite, rather than hutch-xamplr-pp
  -- this was supposed to be a patch release, the 1.3.1 release was supposed to be
     the minor release.

2009-05-11
  -- lots of undocumented changes
  -- when defining the mentions attributes, use 'mentioned_class'
     rather than simply 'class'. Using just 'class' can cause some
     wierd side-effects when querying.

2009-04-16 (version 1.0.2)

  -- if tag starts with a number, prefix it with an 'x' (e.g. 0abc --> x0abc).
     The problem arose if a tag like <0abc> was used in an xml file
     used to generate xampl code. In that case, the 'attribute
     names' associated with the tag would be based on '_abc'. The
     change makes the attribute names be based on x0abc. The choice
     of 'x' is arbitrary, but we can't have a leading digit, and
     the '_' could fail to distinguish certain elements (e.g. 0abc
     and 1abc would both be based on '_abc').
