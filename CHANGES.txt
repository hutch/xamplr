  -- lots of undocumented changes
  -- when defining the mentions attributes, use 'mentioned_class'
     rather than simply 'class'. Using just 'class' can cause some
     wierd side-effects when querying.

  -- if tag starts with a number, prefix it with an 'x' (e.g. 0abc --> x0abc).
     The problem arose if a tag like <0abc> was used in an xml file
     used to generate xampl code. In that case, the 'attribute
     names' associated with the tag would be based on '_abc'. The
     change makes the attribute names be based on x0abc. The choice
     of 'x' is arbitrary, but we can't have a leading digit, and
     the '_' could fail to distinguish certain elements (e.g. 0abc
     and 1abc would both be based on '_abc').
